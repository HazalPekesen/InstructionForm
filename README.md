# InstructionForm
This project is a project that I have prepared for Opteam company and allows you to easily create your instruction reports with your own data.

I used n-tier architecture as a development approach in my project.
The reason for using this structure was to avoid code repetition, to use the dry approach, to facilitate error management and to provide clean code structure.
I also used the code first approach in my development.
in the web ui part, I progressed by layering on the mvc script.
